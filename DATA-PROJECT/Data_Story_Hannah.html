			<h1>"Don't get married young!"</h1>
			<h2>An analysis of US divorce rates</h2>
			<p>If you are thinking of getting married and are under the age of 25, you've probably heard the phrase <span class="callout">"don't get married young"</span>. You may have heard it from concerned parents, friends and faimly who are concerned with one thing: DIVORCE.</p>
			<p>In a study of divorce statistics we discovered that  <span class="callout">25 states</span>, not including Texas, that have at least one of the last two regulations, which were covered in Monday's Supreme Court ruling. That does not include Kansas, which has temporarily enjoined both ambulatory surgical center standards and required hospital privileges, or Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma or Wisconsin, which have temporarily enjoined required hospital privileges.</p>
